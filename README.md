An attempt to create a euchre playing software package / API / AI. This is a learning experience and as such, I've also chosen to use golang to implement it. So it should be fun, let's see what happens! The software will try to compare two different approaches to AI, a rules based approach and a machine learning approach. Methods that use rule based logic will be prefaced with a 'r\_', and those that use machine learning will be prefaced with a 'm\_'.

Enjoy!
